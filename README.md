Hi, I’m Rahul Kaushik— a CAE Engineer and AI & Data Analytics professional. I work on physics-based modeling, simulation and design validation for complex engineering systems using finite element and computational fluid dynamics analysis, vibration and suspension modeling, and thermal–structural simulations to ensure reliability, safety, and performance.
In parallel, I design data-driven solutions that turn complex datasets into actionable insights. My work spans statistical analysis, machine learning, time-series modeling, and predictive analytics, with a focus on building scalable, interpretable models that support sound decision-making and real-world impact.

**Work Experience:**

**Scientific Officer, Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology**
2022 – Present
Leading the development of suspension and seismic subsystems at LIGO India, covering single- and multi-stage suspension assemblies and internal seismic isolation systems. Responsibilities include FEA simulations and Mathematica-based modeling for design, prototyping, and experimental validation, as well as developing control systems and machine learning models for precise optic steering and control of the 10 m interferometer (IFO) at the LIGO India Training and Testing (T&T) Facility.

**Scientific Officer, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre**
2015 – 2022
Led the development of impact-resistant hazardous material transportation casks in compliance with IAEA SSR6 standards, using CAD for prototyping and FEA and Monte Carlo simulations, followed by experimental validation under simulated impact and drop conditions.
