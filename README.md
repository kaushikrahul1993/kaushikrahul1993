# Rahul Kaushik  
**CAE Engineer | AI & Data Analytics Professional**

Hi, I’m Rahul Kaushik, a CAE Engineer and AI & Data Analytics professional with experience in physics-based modeling, simulation, and design validation for complex engineering systems. My work focuses on finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), vibration and suspension modeling, and coupled thermal–structural simulations to ensure reliability, safety, and performance.

In parallel, I design data-driven solutions that transform complex datasets into actionable insights. My expertise includes statistical analysis, machine learning, time-series modeling, and predictive analytics, with an emphasis on building scalable, interpretable models that support robust engineering decisions and real-world impact.
